This is were I drop snippets and small insights that do not fit any other format;
too trivial for a blog post but too long or too structured for Twitter and the like.

Also, this is a playground for tech I wanted to pick up: AsciiDoc, Hugo, and GitHub actions.
Obviously.

Other forms of content end up on:

 - link:https://twitter.com/OmegaPolice][@OmegaPolice] on Twitter, for commentary and trivialities,
 - link:https://github.com/reitzig[reitzig] on GitHub for coding projects, and
 - link:http://reitzig.github.io/[reitzig.github.io], for computer science things (which rests, alas, mostly abandoned).

## German Legalese

While I do not _think_ I need it -- this website being a non-profit, recreational venture -- IANAL applies.
So here comes what German law requires you to put on a maybe-even-remotely-construable-as-commercial website,
at pain of being sent cease-and-desist letters asking for thousands of Euros by random yet ... endeavouring lawyers.
