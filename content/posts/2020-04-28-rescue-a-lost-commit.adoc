By some creative Git juggling, I actually managed to "lose" a commit today.
Believe it or not, that was a first for me!
<!--more-->

More specifically, I accidentally reset a local branch to the wrong place like so:

....
$ git checkout current-pr
< make some changes >
$ git commit -m "Fancy stuff"
< juggling happens, possibly in a UI client >
$ git checkout current-pr
$ git reset --hard other-branch
....

Now, (at least) that latest commit is no longer referenced and does not appear in `+git log+` anymore.
Lucky for me, commits are not that easily lost:

....
$ git reflog
....

Now you get a quite extensive list of operations you ran, which allows you to retrace your steps.
You will be looking for a line similar to this:

....
3376db5 HEAD@{25}: commit: Fancy stuff
....

I had a more expressive commit message, so the revision in question was easy to find.
Now all I had to do was merge this revision into what was left of my branch:

....
$ git reset --hard origin/current-pr
$ git merge --ff 3376db5
....
